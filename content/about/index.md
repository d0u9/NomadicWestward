Hello! I'm Yak, a photographer born on the roof of the world, also known as the Tibetan Plateau. I spent my days in China before 2023 and have been in Australia ever since.

As an amateur freelance photographer, my interests cover a wide range. I first got into photography by taking landscape photos and spent some time immersing myself in the astonishing beauty of nature.

However, things started to change with the COVID pandemic, as people were locked down in their local regions. Inspired by the stories unfolding around me and a call from deep within my heart, I shifted my focus to documenting everyday routines and moments that happened within my reach.

Gradually, as I delved deeper into the world of photography, my aesthetic pursuits grew stronger. Photography, to me, is not just about documentation but also about its visual and emotional appeal. More profoundly, it is a language that speaks between people â€” without vocal cords, but through sentiments.
