# About this site

This is a personal site that showcases my work and reflections on photography, but it is not limited to that. The boundaries blur when the subject matter touches on social issues or other unique contexts.

## Technical Side

This site is powered by the Hugo framework, an open-source Golang static site generator, and is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. Several pages, including this one, were designed with the help of AI.
